# Motorcycle Specs Classification with Ridge Regression
In this project I used a dataset with engine specification of different motorcycle models.
The goal was to create a prediction application capable of predict the final power (hp) of the engine given some features. 
The features chosen was: Bore (mm), Stroke (mm), Engine Configuration (4 cylinder in-line, for example) and the cooling system. 


The model chosen was the Ridge Regression with cross validation (10 k-folds). 
The metric of evaluation chosen was the mean absolute error (MAE). 
The results are ilustrated below:
